<Callout variant="info" title="TL;DR">
  This template demonstrates the structure I use for case studies. It includes sections for context, 
  approach, artifacts, outcomes, and reflection. Use this as a reference when creating new case studies.
</Callout>

<Section heading="Context & Constraints">
  <div>
    Every design project exists within a specific context. Documenting the constraints, 
    goals, and initial state helps readers understand why decisions were made.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    Key things to include:
  </div>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Business goals and success metrics</li>
    <li>Technical constraints</li>
    <li>Timeline and resources</li>
    <li>Team structure and stakeholders</li>
  </ul>
</Section>

<Section heading="Approach">
  <div>
    Describe the methodology, research, and design process. This is where you explain 
    the "how" and "why" of your decisions.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    Consider covering:
  </div>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Research methods and findings</li>
    <li>Design principles applied</li>
    <li>Iteration cycles</li>
    <li>Collaboration approach</li>
  </ul>
</Section>

<Section heading="Artifacts">
  <div>
    Show the work. Include key screens, components, documentation, or other artifacts 
    that demonstrate the solution.
  </div>
  
  <ArtifactGallery
    columns={3}
    artifacts={[
      {
        image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Artifact+1',
        caption: 'Component library overview',
      },
      {
        image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Artifact+2',
        caption: 'Design tokens documentation',
      },
      {
        image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Artifact+3',
        caption: 'Usage examples',
      },
    ]}
  />
</Section>

<Divider />

<Section heading="Outcomes">
  <div>
    What were the results? Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback.
  </div>
  
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-6">
    <Metric
      label="Adoption Rate"
      value="85%"
      helperText="Of components in use"
    />
    <Metric
      label="Time to Build"
      value="-40%"
      helperText="Reduction in feature time"
    />
    <Metric
      label="Design Debt"
      value="-60%"
      helperText="Reduction in inconsistencies"
    />
  </div>
</Section>

<Section heading="What I'd Do Differently">
  <div>
    Honest reflection on what could be improved. This shows growth mindset and helps 
    others learn from your experience.
  </div>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Start with documentation earlier in the process</li>
    <li>Involve developers more in the design phase</li>
    <li>Establish governance from day one</li>
  </ul>
</Section>
