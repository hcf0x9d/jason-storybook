  <div>
    I believe design systems are about enabling teams to move faster while maintaining quality. 
    This means focusing on developer experience, clear documentation, and sustainable processes.

<Section heading="Process">
  <div>
    My work typically follows a structured approach:
  </div>
  <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
    <li>Understand the problem space and constraints</li>
    <li>Design with the system in mind</li>
    <li>Build iteratively with real usage</li>
    <li>Document as you go</li>
    <li>Measure and iterate</li>
  </ol>
</Section>
