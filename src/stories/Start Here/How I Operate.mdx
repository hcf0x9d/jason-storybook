        This page reflects how I work day to day—not a theoretical process, but the operating principles I’ve used
        leading design systems, workflows, and cross-functional teams in complex product environments.

          Great products aren’t built in isolation. I view design as connective tissue—linking business goals, user needs,
          and technical execution into a shared understanding of the problem.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">The process</h3>
        <p>
          Critique is a tool for clarity, not performance. I facilitate discussions that surface blind spots, challenge
          assumptions, and align the team on the problem—rather than defend a single solution.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
          Decisions are finalized based on evidence, user needs, and business context—with a clear owner responsible for
          moving forward.

      <div className="space-y-2">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Handling disagreement</h3>
        <p>
          Disagreement is healthy when it’s about the work. I encourage multiple perspectives and make space for dissent.
          When ambiguity remains, decisions are grounded in primary user needs and business constraints.

            I use AI as an accelerator and support tool—not a decision-maker. It helps handle rote work, explore
            alternatives, and move faster through low-leverage tasks, allowing teams to focus on judgment, taste,
            empathy, and strategic thinking.
